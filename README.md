Galaxy Hopper

Developed by: Brian Bugieda, Ryan Emenheiser, Korey Mitchell, Marwane Adlani, Max Luu

Galaxy Hopper is a javascript based web application inspired by the arcade game Asteroids. The game was made by modifying the document object model (DOM) rather than using canvas. Was also created using HTML and CSS. Development time spanned about 3 weeks for Advanced Web Technologies (CISC474) at the University of Delaware.
